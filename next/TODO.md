## 5. Electron Build with Auto-Update via GitHub Actions
Set up CI/CD for Windows Electron builds with automatic updates.

- Electron is already configured (`electron/main.js`, `electron/preload.js`, electron-builder in `package.json`)
- Windows NSIS target is configured (`win.target: "nsis"`, `win.icon: "public/icon.ico"`)
- **GitHub Actions**: Create workflow to build Windows installer on push/release
- **Auto-update**: Integrate `electron-updater` for automatic updates from GitHub Releases
- **Code signing**: Set up Windows code signing (optional but recommended)
- **Build artifacts**: Publish `.exe` installer and update metadata (`latest.yml`) to GitHub Releases
- Note: Icon files (`public/icon.ico`, `public/icon.icns`) are referenced but don't exist yet -- need to be created first (see task 6)

## 6. Logo and Branding
Add proper branding throughout the application.

- **App icon**: Create `public/icon.ico` (Windows) and `public/icon.icns` (macOS) for Electron builds -- currently referenced in electron-builder config but missing
- **Favicon**: No favicon exists -- add `favicon.ico` and configure in `app/layout.tsx`
- **Page metadata**: Title is still "Create Next App" and description is "Generated by create next app" in `app/layout.tsx` -- update to "Simple POS" with proper description
- **Receipt logo**: Logo upload for receipts already works via Settings > Logo Upload -- this is separate from app branding
- **Loading/splash screen**: Consider adding branded splash screen for Electron startup
